# Vehicle counting App

Monitoring heavy traffic is becoming a challenge with increase in the city traffic by each passing day. What if there is a smart vision based solution which harnesses the feed from cctv cameras at the traffic signals and gives the administration an accurate count of different vehicles that pass through a particular junction or area on a daily basis. This would help management to deploy necessary workforce and also manage the traffic signals more efficiently. This app, built on Nvidia's Deepsteam SDK, would also help corporate buildings, commercial complexes to manage their parking systems based on exact number of vehicles which have entered and exited specific premises, avoiding overcrowding and less wait time. It also identifies the different vehicle types like car, bus, bike, truck to help the management understand the traffic and number of vehicles from each vehicle type.

## Introduction

The Vehicle Detection and counting Application consists of a pipleline powered by Deepstream, that can be run on Nvidia power DGPU's as well as Jetson Devices such as the Jetson Xavier NX, Jeson Nano, Jetson Xavier AGX and the TX2.

## Deepstream Setup

This post assumes you have a fully functional Jetson device. If not, you can refer the documentation [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/jetson/jetpack/install-jetpack/index.html).

### 1. Install System Dependencies

```sh
sudo apt install \
libssl1.0.0 \
libgstreamer1.0-0 \
gstreamer1.0-tools \
gstreamer1.0-plugins-good \
gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad \
gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly \
gstreamer1.0-libav \
libgstrtspserver-1.0-0 \
libjansson4=2.11-1
uuid \
uuid-dev
```

### 2. Install Deepstream on Dgpu's

Download the DeepStream 5.1 Debian package `deepstream-5.1_5.1.0-1_amd64.deb`, to the DGPU device from [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk-download-tesla-archived). Then enter the command:

```sh
sudo apt-get install ./deepstream-5.1_5.1.0-1_amd64.deb
```

### 3. Install Deepstream in Jetson Devices

Download the deb file under - DeepStream 5.1 for Jetson from [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/deepstream-on-jetson-downloads-archived).

```sh
sudo apt-get install ./deepstream-5.1_5.1.0-1_amd64.deb
```

## Run the Application

### 1. Clone the repository

First, install git and git-lfs

```sh
sudo apt install git git-lfs
```

Next, clone the repository

```sh
# Using HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/aakashasimroy/VehicleCount.git
# Using SSH
git clone git@github.com:aakashasimroy/VehicleCount.git
```

Now, enable lfs and pull the yolo weights

```sh
git lfs install
git lfs pull
```

### 2. Run with different input sources

The computer vision part of the solution can be run on one or many input sources of multiple types, all powered using NVIDIA Deepstream.

Firstly, we must build the application by running the following command:

```sh
make clean && make -j$(nproc)
```

This will generate the binary called `vehicleCount-app`. This is a one-time step and you need to do this only when you make source-code changes.

Next, create a file called `inputsources.txt` and paste the path of videos or rtsp url of CCTV IP cameras.

```sh
file:///home/aakash/Downloads/traffic.mp4
```

Now, run the application by running the following command:

```sh
./vehicleCount-app
```
